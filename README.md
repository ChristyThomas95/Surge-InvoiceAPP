## Introduction

This is the second part of my capstone project, "Surge Fruit Store." I created this project as a minor feature for the main website. This project aims to give the merchant the upper hand to create and send an invoice with their phones. The user can create and send the invoice to the buyer through their phones rather than through a pc. 

**Available for both iOS and Android.**

## Build Process

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))
